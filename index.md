This is an open source project written primarily by 086, dominikaaaa and iBuyMountainDew. It has many useful combat and general utilities to assist the player. 

See the [FAQ](/faq) pages for information about using the mod itself, and the [modules](/modules) page for information about the 160+ unique modules this mod has.

This project was started by 086 in early 2018, and it gained popularity for having the best CrystalAura.
In late 2019 dominikaaaa picked up the project, noticing the lack of modules, with iBuyMountainDew taking over the project after 6 months of work by dominikaaaa. 

086 ported the original project to the Fabric mod system, in early 2020, with dominikaaaa making plans to port Blue to the new plugin system for it.

<p>
    See <a href="https://github.com/fr1kin/forgehax">forgehax</a> for an equivalent. Some features in KAMI may be based on those of forgehax, and KAMI / KAMI Blue have some features it doesn't. KAMI Blue won't be based off of other mods unless said otherwise.

    If you get banned for breaking a servers rules using KAMI Blue, it is not any of the developers fault. It is meant to be used on *anarchy* servers, which do not have rules.
