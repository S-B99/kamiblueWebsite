## Building and Contributing

***

Please make sure to restart your IDE and reimport ðŸ”„ gradle after running all the setup

***

You are free to clone, modify KAMI Blue and make pull requests as you wish. 

Before contributing please see the [Code of Conduct](codeofconduct)

See [Support](support.html) for help.

***

### Contributing 

To set up your development environment, make use of the following instructions:

```
git clone {{ site.github.repository_url }}
```
Import KAMI Blue into your IDE of choice. 

If you use Intellij, import the `build.gradle` file

If you use Eclipse, import a new gradle project and select the `kamiblue` folder. 

If you have gradle related issues with either of these force your gradle version to `4.10.3`

If you do not wish to run from an IDE, use `./gradlew runClient` to run KAMI Blue 
(not recommended due to random issues. run `./gradlew clean` if you experience any with it)

#### Running in Intellij IDEA

1. Wait for the Gradle import to finish. 
2. In the Gradle tab, hit the reimport ðŸ”„ button. If you don't see the Gradle tab on the very right of Intellij, go to File -> Close Project, and then reopen the project. 
Make sure your workspace is setup as per above, and then hit reimport ðŸ”„ inside Gradle.
3. Expand the tab -> expand `Forgegradle`
4. Run `genIntellijRuns` in the tab you just expanded
5. Restart Intellij
6. You'll see a `Minecraft Client`. Select it, and hit edit.
7. Change the classpath to `folderName.main`
8. You can now just hit the green play button to open Minecraft with your current changes

### Building

***

If you get build errors see this (although 99% of the time it's going to be code that's broken): [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting)

***

#### Linux

You can build by running these commands (without the <>) in a terminal.

```
git clone {{ site.github.repository_url }} kamiblue && cd kamiblue
./gradlew build
```

To use the built jar, find a file in `build/libs` called `<folderName>-<kamiVersion>-release.jar` which you can copy to the `mods` folder of a Minecraft instance that has Forge 1.12.2 installed.

***

#### Windows

0. Make sure you have [Oracle JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) installed first. 
1. Navigate to where you downloaded KAMI Blue, open the folder, and in the file path, double click to open the full file path. 
2. Type `cmd` and hit enter.
3. This will open `cmd` with the current directory (`cd`) being the KAMI Blue folder. Now type this

```
gradlew.bat build
```

4. and hit enter. 

To use the built jar, find a file in `build/libs` called `<folderName>-<kamiVersion>-release.jar` which you can copy to the `mods` folder of a Minecraft instance that has Forge 1.12.2 installed.
