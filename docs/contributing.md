## Building and Contributing

***

Please make sure to restart your IDE and reimport gradle in after running all setup commands

***

You are free to clone, modify KAMI and KAMI Blue and make pull requests as you wish. 

Before contributing please see the [Code of Conduct](codeofconduct)

See [Support](support.html) for help.

### Contributing 

To set up your development environment, make use of the following commands:

Of-course you can also use a Gradle installation if you for some reason want another version of gradle
```
git clone https://github.com/S-B99/kamiblue/
```
Import KAMI Blue into your IDE of choice. 
```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
./gradlew genIntellijRuns #for intellij
./gradlew eclipse #for eclipse
```
If you use IntelliJ, import `build.gradle`

If you use Eclipse, import a new gradle project and select the `kamiblue` folder. 

If you have gradle related issues with either of these force your gradle version to `4.8.1`

If you do not wish to run from an IDE, use `./gradlew runClient` to run KAMI Blue.

Note: I don't recommend using runClient as sometimes it's wonky. If you have issues then do `./gradlew clean`

#### Running in Intellij Idea

Make sure your workspace is setup as per above, and then hit reimport inside gradle

Then go to your Minecraft Client in the run tab, and change the classpath to `kamiblue.main`, as it will give an error if you don't. Then you can run it through intellij. 


### Building

***

If you get build errors see this (although 99% of the time it's going to be code that's broken): [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting)

***

#### Linux

You can build by running these commands (without the <>) in a terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/S-B99/kamiblue/ && cd kamiblue

chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew build
```

To use the built jar, find a file in `build/libs` called `kamiblue-<kamiVersion>-**release**.jar` which you can copy to the `mods/1.12.2` folder of a minecraft instance that has forge installed.

***

#### Windows

You can build by running these commands in a terminal with the current directory being the previously downloaded KAMI Blue. (EG. `cd C:\Users\%username%\Downloads\kamiblue`)
```
gradlew.bat build
```

To use the built jar, find a file in `build/libs` called `kamiblue-<kamiVersion>-**release**.jar` which you can copy to the `mods/1.12.2` folder of a minecraft instance that has forge installed.
