### Release Highlights

This release contains a lot of preparation for the upcoming plugins framework, which will soon allow for the community to create their own modules, commands and more to be freely installed and uninstalled at will. Along with that, we've fixed a ton of bugs and enhanced the functionality of quite a few modules including NoteBot, InventoryManager, Strafe and the HUD itself.

Please provide feedback so we can improve the project even more for the next release! :D
